We explored health and nutrition in America and identified obesity as one one health outcome/ problem that we placed a focus on. Obesity is putting a strain on American families, affecting overall health, health care costs, productivity, and military readiness.

## Map
We created a choropleth map visualizing "percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity". This includes an average of data values from 2011-2021. More information about the coding process can be found in Mapping_Documentation.docx.
- Observations include: 
    - Highest levels of obesity: Louisiana followed by Alaska, and then New Mexico (all 32%+)
    - Lowest levels of obesity: Utah (29.99%) and Massachusetts (30.05%) 
- Contributing Factors to consider:
    - Low income 
    - Smoking habits
    - Alcohol consumption 
    - Limited physical activity and sedentary behavior(s)

## Adults Who Achieve Physical Activity Goal Based on Age
We also created a bubble graph that showed the “percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic and engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week”. The graph shows physical activity within a  bubble chart, the larger the bubble references the more physical activity the age groups partook in.
- All data points look similar as we age over time, however, in 2019 we begin to see all age groups see a steady increase in activity levels.
- We believe this data shows that all around more awareness in health concerns, the US population began to make physical activity more of a priority.

## Nutrition Food Groups
We created a three dimensional chart to display various foods and their corresponding proteins, carbs, and fats content. 
This information can help people seeking to make positive dietary changes and lead a healthier lifestyle because each macronutrient has different impact on our body’s biological processes.

## Conclusion
The relationship between nutrition and obesity is multifaceted and can vary based on various factors, including individual dietary choices, lifestyle, genetics, and environmental factors. While there is no simple direct cause-and-effect relationship between nutrition and obesity, research suggests that nutrition plays a significant role in the development and prevalence of obesity.
